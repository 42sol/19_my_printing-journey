This is a journaling style knowledge base about things I am learning on my voyage with 3D-printing - or making in its broader sense.

I use this to keep my notes.
I am learning from others and love how they share.
So if this thoughts are helpful to others that is really great!
Feel free to start it or to even write me a note.

## My Position (reflection)

Setup my [[references]] (including cheat sheets) and evaluate the [[apps]] available and their helpfulness to me.

## Ideas (collection)
Collection of ideas and [[projects]].
