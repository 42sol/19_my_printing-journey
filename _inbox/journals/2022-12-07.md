## Push to kindle

> Push to kindle email only works from your registered amazon email.

> The kindle browser extension seems not really to work properly, I used EpubPress and send it to my personal inbox (e.g. Gmail) and den use the link www.amazon.de/sendtokindle. I catched it not working also, but more stable than the browser extension up to now.

> TIP: The EpubPress has the benefit of compiling more than one tab to a single Epub-book, which looks like a good thing from this point of view (using it one day!)
