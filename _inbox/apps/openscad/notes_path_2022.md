# Notes for 2022

## May

I started using scad-Files very early to generate special bricks for projects to be used in combination with bricks from the stores.

Also to generate personalized rings in size and for the text.
My kids loved that they could wear teir special rings and that I could reprint it, if it got too small.

## November

### Add text tags to Prusa Slicer

I was interested in getting my often reused texts into the gallery of PrusaSlicer to make easy tweaks (personalizations) of my models - like adding the names of my kids to it.
This was a perfect catch for OpenSCAD - and the base for my first model on printables.com.

### Cut model 

I refocused on OpenSCAD for splitting up a model that had a specifically long bridging part, knowing that the printer I used had a weak side on that. Not to print the full model but only one quarter, made me evaluate - and in that specific case fail - fater, even with the generated supports from the slicer.

### Cut and extend

Next step was a combination of a cut model (only one half) with a plate on the back with scewed holes.

The added texts i added for fun I did in PrusaSlicer but where generated by OpenSCAD too.
