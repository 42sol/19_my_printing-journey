# application Simplify3d 

{the_app} was the first slicer I used. Beeing a payed/commercial software (price 150US$) it impressed me with the good user interface and some very special features - especially the easy way of modifing print settings depending on layers ((in 2022 these features have found their way into the oder [[slicer_apps]] and are therefore no longer a good argument to invest money it the tool)). Sadly the long overdue update for version 5.0 is not released by the company. Futher more the last blog entry was posted on 9th December 2021.

Another great feature was the type of manually placing supports.
> This feature I will solve by using [[OpenSCAD]]

There is multi material support in simplify3D!

The company was founded in 2013.
> It seems that COVID-pandemie also killed that company.

Please feel free to correct me / notify me if this changes.
I have moved on to PrusaSlicer in 2022 and will therefore not monnitor the progress of this topic closely
